A small program to help me update my volume covers from MangaDex. Very WIP. 

1. Type `python main.py` and a window will open. 
2. Open the directory for the volume covers, then paste the url of the MangaDex entry. 
3. You will be prompted with what you want to be updated. Hit process to save them into your volume.
4. Must have chromedriver and chrome installed and chromedriver on PATH
